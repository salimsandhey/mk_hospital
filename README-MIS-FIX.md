# MIS System Fix Documentation

## Issue
The MIS dashboard and report pages were encountering a fatal error:
```
Fatal error: Uncaught mysqli_sql_exception: Table 'mk-live.patients' doesn't exist in C:\xampp\htdocs\mk-live\misDashboard.php:11 Stack trace: #0 C:\xampp\htdocs\mk-live\misDashboard.php(11): mysqli_query(Object(mysqli), 'SELECT COUNT(*)...') #1 {main} thrown in C:\xampp\htdocs\mk-live\misDashboard.php on line 11
```

## Root Cause
After examining the database structure in `mk-live.sql`, we found that the MIS system was trying to query a table called `patients` (plural), but the actual table in the database is named `patient` (singular).

Additionally, some field names were incorrect:
- The MIS system was looking for a `created_at` field for patient registration date, but the actual field is `registration_date`
- The MIS system was looking for a `phone` field for patient contact information, but the actual field is `contact`
- The MIS system was using `TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, date_of_birth, CURDATE())` to calculate age, but the database already has an `age` field

## Changes Made

### 1. misDashboard.php
- Changed table name from `patients` to `patient`
- Changed field name from `created_at` to `registration_date`

### 2. patientReport.php
- Changed table name from `patients` to `patient`
- Changed field name from `created_at` to `registration_date`
- Changed field name from `phone` to `contact`
- Changed age calculation to use the `age` field directly instead of calculating from `date_of_birth`

### 3. visitReport.php
- Changed table name from `patients` to `patient`
- Changed field name from `phone` to `contact`

## Verification
The existing patient-related pages (`patients.php` and `fetchPatients.php`) were already using the correct table name `patient`, which confirms our fix is aligned with the rest of the application.

## Next Steps
After these changes, the MIS dashboard and report pages should work correctly. If any other issues arise, they should be addressed on a case-by-case basis.

## Note
The header.php file already includes the link to the MIS dashboard, so no changes were needed there.
